# Basic C++: Arrays

Arrays are extremely helpful when you need several of the same variable.
Instead of having 50 separate variables, use one array to store all 50.
This makes managing nondistinct objects much easier.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
